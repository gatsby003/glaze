# Glaze 

Glaze is a new tab extension , based primarily on productivity and great UX, it is still in early phase of development, I have only pushed the create-react-app build for now, but I plan to push the extension version along with build instructions in a few days. Currently glaze has the functionality of setting a nice backgorund with a clock + greeting feature. 

Currently the frontend fetches state from the glaze-api which Im developing locally , I'll push that in a couple of days too

# Next I plan to 

* ~~add more customization options to the user~~
* ~~do a redux re-write since i think state managaement will be a pain as the app grows~~
* ~~organise css better , even at this stage the css is getting out of hand ~~


Macha because I was watching a kenny sebastian podcast at the time , lol
